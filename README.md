# Supermarket management system

Hey, I'd like to present my project, which aimed to practice object-oriented programming skills using class inheritance and creating abstractions. This is one of my first larger projects. 


## Running the project

To run the program, you need to have the 'Boost' library installed on your computer first.
To run the program, navigate to the project folder and use the command `bash start.sh`.


## Project goals

1. Utilizing the object-oriented programming capabilities offered by the C++ language.
2. Practical application of inheritance.
3. Application of abstract methods and functions.
4. Implementation of a very simple database (file operations on text files).
5. Creating an application that's easy to modify later (separation into separate files).
6. Applying good programming practices.


## Functionalities

1. Product overview.
2. Searching for products by name, price, or ID.
3. Adding a new product to the database.
4. Editing a product in the database.
5. Deleting a product from the database.
6. Managing employees.
